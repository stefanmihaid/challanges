# Question:
# With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 8
# Then, the output should be:
# {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}


def square(n):
	rezultat = {}
	i = 1
	while i <= n:
		rezultat[i] = i**2
		i +=1
	return rezultat



print square(8)
